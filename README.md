Background
Machine Learning

Machine learning (ML) is the process of constructing a mathematical model of a system based on a sample dataset collected from that system.

One of the main goals of training an ML model is to teach the model to separate the signal present in the data from the noise inherent in system and in the data collection process. If this is done effectively, the model can then be used to make accurate predictions about the system when presented with new, similar data. Additionally, introspecting on an ML model can reveal key information about the system being modeled, such as which inputs and transformations of the inputs are most useful to the ML model for learning the signal in the data, and are therefore the most predictive.

There are a variety of ML problem types. Supervised learning describes the case where the collected data contains an output value to be modeled and a set of inputs with which to train the model. EvalML focuses on training supervised learning models.

EvalML supports three common supervised ML problem types. The first is regression, where the target value to model is a continuous numeric value. Next are binary and multiclass classification, where the target value to model consists of two or more discrete values or categories. The choice of which supervised ML problem type is most appropriate depends on domain expertise and on how the model will be evaluated and used.

EvalML is currently building support for supervised time series problems: time series regression, time series binary classification, and time series multiclass classification. While weâ€™ve added some features to tackle these kinds of problems, our functionality is still being actively developed so please be mindful of that before using it.

AutoML and Search

AutoML is the process of automating the construction, training and evaluation of ML models. Given a data and some configuration, AutoML searches for the most effective and accurate ML model or models to fit the dataset. During the search, AutoML will explore different combinations of model type, model parameters and model architecture.

An effective AutoML solution offers several advantages over constructing and tuning ML models by hand. AutoML can assist with many of the difficult aspects of ML, such as avoiding overfitting and underfitting, imbalanced data, detecting data leakage and other potential issues with the problem setup, and automatically applying best-practice data cleaning, feature engineering, feature selection and various modeling techniques. AutoML can also leverage search algorithms to optimally sweep the hyperparameter search space, resulting in model performance which would be difficult to achieve by manual training.

AutoML in EvalML
EvalML supports all of the above and more.

In its simplest usage, the AutoML search interface requires only the input data, the target data and a problem_type specifying what kind of supervised ML problem to model.

** Graphing methods, like verbose AutoMLSearch, on Jupyter Notebook and Jupyter Lab require ipywidgets to be installed.

** If graphing on Jupyter Lab, jupyterlab-plotly required. To download this, make sure you have npm installed.
